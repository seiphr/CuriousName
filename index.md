# Win a Prize if Your Name is a Prime Number!

Every day, when Christopher arrives at the Theater im Seefeld, he chooses two seats in each row at random as his selected prime number seats. Anyone sitting in a selected prime number seat has the chance to win a prize!*

Prime numbers can only be divided by themselves and 1. 2 is the first prime number because 1 can only be divided by 1. There are no known formulas to help discover new prime numbers, which is maybe why Christopher finds them so interestingâ€¦

## How to Play

Give each letter in your name a value from 1 to 26 (`a=1`, `b=2`, etc.)

<!-- Start of the table with custom CSS -->
<style>
  .custom-table {
    border: 2px solid black;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    width: 100%;
  }
  .custom-table th, .custom-table td {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 4px;
    text-align: center;
  }
  .custom-table th {
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
  }
</style>

<table class="custom-table">
    <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
        <th>D</th>
        <th>E</th>
        <th>F</th>
        <th>G</th>
        <th>H</th>
        <th>I</th>
        <th>J</th>
        <th>K</th>
        <th>L</th>
        <th>M</th>
        <th>N</th>
        <th>O</th>
        <th>P</th>
        <th>Q</th>
        <th>R</th>
        <th>S</th>
        <th>T</th>
        <th>U</th>
        <th>V</th>
        <th>W</th>
        <th>X</th>
        <th>Y</th>
        <th>Z</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>11</td>
        <td>12</td>
        <td>13</td>
        <td>14</td>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>17</td>
        <td>18</td>
        <td>19</td>
        <td>20</td>
        <td>21</td>
        <td>22</td>
        <td>23</td>
        <td>24</td>
        <td>25</td>
        <td>26</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Add up the numbers and see if they make a prime number. Like Scooby Doo (113), or Sherlock Holmes (163), or Doctor Watson (167).

### Example (Scooby Doo)

> S=19, C=3, O=15, O=15, B=2, Y=25, D=4, O=15, O=15
>
> `19 + 3 + 15 + 15 + 2 + 25 + 4 + 15 + 15 = 113`

If your name equals a prime number, please come to the foyer during the interval or after the show, and ask one of the ushers there for a Curious Prize. We will double-check your calculation for you ðŸ™‚
