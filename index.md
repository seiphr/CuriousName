# Win a Prize if Your Name is a Prime Number!

Every day, when Christopher arrives at the Theater im Seefeld, he chooses two seats in each row at random as his selected prime number seats. Anyone sitting in a selected prime number seat has the chance to win a prize!*

Prime numbers can only be divided by themselves and 1. 2 is the first prime number because 1 can only be divided by 1. There are no known formulas to help discover new prime numbers, which is maybe why Christopher finds them so interestingâ€¦

## How to Play

Each letter in your full name (first and last name) has a value from 1 to 26 (`a=1`, `b=2`, etc.). Ignore any special characters like hyphens `-`.

Add up the numbers and see if they make a prime number. Like `Scooby Doo` (113), or `Sherlock Holmes` (163), or `Doctor Watson` (167).

If your name equals a prime number, please come to the foyer during the interval or after the show, and ask one of the ushers there for a Curious Prize. We will double-check your calculation for you ðŸ™‚

### Prime Numbers up to 500

<div class="table-container">
    <table class="custom-table">
        <tbody>
            <tr id="prime-row"></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

### Example (Scooby Doo)

```
S=19, C=3, O=15, O=15, B=2, Y=25, D=4, O=15, O=15

19 + 3 + 15 + 15 + 2 + 25 + 4 + 15 + 15 = 113
```

`113` is a prime number, so `Scooby Doo` would win a prize!

## Check Your Calculation

<style>
    /* Style for the form and the result text */
    form {
        margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    .result {
        margin-top: 20px;
        color: red;
        font-weight: bold;
    }
</style>

Try to calculate your number on your own and check the prime numbers table first, then fill in your name below to find out if you got it right!

_Only use characters A-Z (no umlauts or numbers). Special characters will be ignored in the calculation. Enter your full name (first and last name)._

<form onsubmit="handleSubmit(event)">
    <label for="name">Enter your full name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Scooby Doo">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    <p></p>
    <div id="result" class="result" style="display: none;"></div>
</form>
